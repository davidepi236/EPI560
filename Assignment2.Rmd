## Question 1

This statement is problematic because if the correlation does not reflect true cause, it would be a spurious correlation - and treating it like a causal effect may not lead to improvement in health in the future. 

## Question 2

First number = E (exposure), second number = A (adherence)
risk difference: $$E(Y^{11} - Y^{01})$$
risk ratio: $$\frac{E(Y^{11})}{E(Y^{01})}$$
Odds ratio: $$\frac{OddsE(Y^{11})}{OddsE(Y^{01})}$$

## Question 3

Difference between the risk if the entire treated population would receive four consecutive days (days 1-4) of treatment versus the risk if the entire treated population would received only three consecutive days of treatment (days 1-3).

## Question 4

$$\frac{E(Y^{d_{4}=1})}{E(Y^{d_{4}=0})}$$

## Question 5



##Question 6

Risk difference: If all smokers quit smoking they would have a 12.9% reduction in risk of high blood pressure (12.9 out of 100 fewer former smokers would not develop high blood pressure)
Risk  Ratio: If all smokers quit smoking, their risk of high blood pressure would be 53% of the risk if they had continued to smoke.
Odds Ratio: If all smokers quit smoking, their odds of high blood pressure would be 45% of the odds if the had continued to smoke.
